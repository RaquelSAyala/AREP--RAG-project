AREP LAB04: Introduction to Creating RAGs (Retrieval-Augmented Generators) with OpenAI

The primary objective of this lab is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts and practical implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generators (RAGs) using OpenAI’s tools and LangChain framework. 

By the end of the lab, students will have gained hands-on experience building and understanding RAGs, culminating in the delivery of two GitHub repositories showcasing their work.

Key technologies used in this lab include:
1. LangChain: A framework for building LLM applications.
2. Pinecone: A vector database for efficient document retrieval.
3. gemini-2.5-flash:LLM (GPT-3.5) and the embedding models.

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique that combines retrieval of relevant documents from a knowledge base with a generative model like GPT to produce more accurate and context-aware responses.
